# Language support
{: #language-support}

{{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudiofull}} provides support for training an annotator component in several languages.

Support for multiple languages does not mean that the product itself is translated. The {{site.data.keyword.watson}}&trade; {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} user interfaces, messages, and documentation are available in English only.
{: shortdesc}

You can train an annotator component in the following languages:

- English (the default language)
- Arabic
- Brazilian Portuguese
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Dutch
- French
- German
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Spanish

Support includes the ability to add documents in these languages to a workspace, add dictionaries, run pre-annotation, use the Ground Truth Editor to annotate documents, and train a machine-learning annotator. When you select a language, the system applies language-specific templates to handle dictionary entries, text tokenization, and sentence segmentation. For information about how the system handles dictionaries in different languages, see [Dictionaries](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/dictionaries.html#wks_dictionaries).

> **Note:** The rule editor and rule annotator cannot handle bidirectional text, so cannot be used with Arabic documents.

> **Restrictions:**
>
> Because of character restrictions in the underlying machine-learning technology, entries in the type system cannot contain spaces and can include only the following ASCII characters:
>
> - A through Z and a through z
> - 0 through 9
> - The underscore character: _
>
> The following rules also apply:
>
> - The first character in the name must be alphabetical.
> - The entity type name length cannot exceed 64 characters.
> - The relation type name length cannot exceed 128 characters.
>
> Thus, for example, when a human annotator annotates Japanese text in the Ground Truth Editor, the entity type and relation type names that can be applied will not be in Japanese.
